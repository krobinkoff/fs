					<h3>Founder & Project Lead</h3>
					<p>I have been a Cryptocurrency investor and have also worked for the Dallas Cowboys Private Social Club since 2017. I am currently studying Philosophy and Psychology: more specifically, variations of Eastern Zen Philosophy and also the works of Carl Jung. My current writings and research involve critically dismantling the fallacies and conclusions behind Novelty Theory, in order to bring useful wisdom to one's daily life. Kranz Token was inspired by one of my dreams back in November 2019 and I will do everything that I can to bring my full vision into reality. Whether it is in the realm of Philosophy or Cryptocurrency, I hope to leave an impact that will make at least one person’s day a bit easier.</p>

					<h3>Co-Founder</h3>
					<p>I am a recent graduate with a degree of History and Political Science from the University of Kansas. After practicing collegiate debate for five years, I have sharpened my research and argumentative skills on a wide variety of topics: ranging from foreign economic interactions, to US financial policy. I am taking advantage of my passions for academic research and my understanding of the world’s current financial state to create new and unique ideas for the Kranz Token. With my debate experience and the effective incentive of the Kranz Token reward system, it is easy for businesses to decide to accept Cryptocurrency and partner with us.</p>

					<h3>Developer</h3>
					<p>I am currently pursuing a Masters in CS with a focus in Data Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. As an avid tinkerer, rock climber, and gamer, I am always excited for new opportunities to learn. As someone fond of building platforms and projects, it was a no-brainer to join the journey of Kranz Token by helping with front-end design and assets to tackle the challenges of crypto mass-adoption!</p>
